ABOUT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a Java implementation of the Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised
by the mathematician John Conway. For more information on the game of life,
visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life.

BUILDING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program of course requires the presence of a JDK to be compiled. Also, it
uses Ant to manage the build. To compile and run the program, ensure those two
dependencies are installed, then cd into the top-level directory (the one with
build.xml) and run 'ant'. That's it!
